The path is designed to help you understand bit by bit. So in the beginning we will focus on simplicity and add upon it step by step.

In my own beginning I started using jupyter notebook, but then switched to a spyder environment, as for me debugging was easier - especially for working through the [stable-baselines3-zoo codebase](https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3).
